Containerization of the Spring Java Application
Objectives:
Package the application into a Docker container.
Ensure the containerized application is environment agnostic and scalable.
Tasks:
Prepare the Application:

Review and update the application's properties and configurations to ensure they are externalized or can be overridden via environment variables.
Implement health checks (e.g., liveness and readiness probes) if not already present.
Dockerize the Application:

Create a Dockerfile at the root of the project.
Use an official Java image as the base image.
Add instructions to copy the application JAR/WAR file into the container.
Expose the application's port.
Define the command to run the application.
Local Testing:

Build the Docker image locally.
Run the container to ensure the application starts and runs correctly.
Documentation:

Document the Docker build and run commands.
Include troubleshooting tips for common issues.
2. Storing Docker Containers in Artifactory
Objectives:
Push the Docker image to a secure, private repository in Artifactory.
Version control Docker images.
Tasks:
Configure Artifactory:

Set up a Docker repository in Artifactory if not already available.
Configure repository permissions based on the team's access requirements.
CI/CD Integration:

Modify the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to include steps for building the Docker image and pushing it to Artifactory.
Ensure the pipeline uses version tags for each push to maintain version history.
Documentation:

Document the process for versioning images.
Include steps for retrieving images from Artifactory.
3. Creating a Helm Chart for Deployment
Objectives:
Facilitate the deployment of the containerized application to Kubernetes.
Ensure configurations are manageable and scalable.
Tasks:
Helm Chart Development:

Create a new Helm chart for the application.
Define templates for Kubernetes deployment, service, and any other necessary resources.
Use Helm values to parameterize the deployment (e.g., image repository, tag, port, environment variables).
Integration with Apps of Apps:

If using an Apps of Apps approach (e.g., with Argo CD), include the application's Helm chart as a dependency in the appropriate parent chart.
Configure the Helm release to be part of the Apps of Apps directory.
Testing and Validation:

Deploy the application using Helm to a test Kubernetes environment.
Validate the deployment by checking the application's functionality and accessibility.
Documentation:

Document the Helm chart structure and customization options.
Include instructions for deploying and updating the application using Helm.
4. Implementation and Monitoring
Objectives:
Deploy the application smoothly to the production environment.
Ensure ongoing monitoring and easy rollback capabilities.
Tasks:
Deployment:

Coordinate the deployment to the production environment.
Ensure all pre-requisites are met before deployment (e.g., environment variables, database migrations).
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack) for the application.
Define alerts for critical metrics and logs.
Rollback Plan:

Prepare a rollback plan in case of issues with the new deployment.
Document the rollback process using Helm.
Post-Deployment Review:

Conduct a post-deployment review to identify any issues or improvements.
Update documentation based on findings.
